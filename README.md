👋 Hi, I'm Sk Shane Alam 👩🏻‍💻
I'm a Data Science & Analytics enthusiast with a strong foundation in Data Science and a deep interest in extracting insights from data. Holding a B.tech degree in Computer Scince and Engnerring(Big Data Anayltics) , I've developed strong problem-solving, logical reasoning, and analytical thinking skills that I now apply to real-world data challenges.

I work extensively with Python, SQL, and Business Intelligence tools to clean, analyze, and visualize data. I love crafting clear, insightful visual stories that make complex information easy to understand, while continuously taking on projects that challenge me to grow as a data professional. My interests also extend to data storytelling and exploring new tools and techniques to sharpen my existing skills.

I’m constantly learning, building projects, and exploring new opportunities to grow in the data field. Beyond analytics, I also enjoy tech content writing, where I simplify analytical concepts for a wider audience.
